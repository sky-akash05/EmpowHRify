## Project README

### Project Structure Overview

#### Frontend
- **app**:
  - **(home)**: Contains components related to the home page.
    - **[user].js**: Dynamic route handling for individual user pages.
    - **_layout.js**: Layout component used across multiple pages.
    - **adddetails.js**: Component for adding details.
    - **employees.js**: Component related to employee details or listing.
    - **index.js**: Home page component.
    - **markattendance.js**: Component for marking attendance.
    - **summary.js**: Component for summarizing attendance data.
  - **assets**: Contains images used in the application.
  - **components**: Reusable components used throughout the app.
    - **SearchResults.js**: Component for displaying search results.
  - **App.js**: Main entry point of the frontend application.
  - **app.json**: Configuration file for React Native app.
  - **babel.config.js**: Babel configuration file.
  - **package-lock.json**: Dependency lock file.
  - **package.json**: Frontend package.json containing dependencies and scripts.

#### Backend (API)
- **api**: Backend directory.
  - **models**: Contains Mongoose models for interacting with MongoDB.
    - **attendance.js**: Defines the schema and model for attendance records.
    - **employee.js**: Defines the schema and model for employee records.
  - **index.js**: Main backend entry point.
  - **package.json**: Backend package.json containing dependencies and scripts.
  - **yarn.lock**: Yarn lock file.
  
#### Database
- **MongoDB**: No specific folder here, but MongoDB is used as the database management system.

### Flow and Architecture

1. **Frontend (React Native)**
   - **App.js**: Entry point for the React Native application. Initializes navigation and routes to different screens based on user interaction.
   - **Components**: Reusable UI components like `SearchResults.js` are used throughout different screens.
   - **Screens**: Each screen (`home/index.js`, `[user].js`, `markattendance.js`, `summary.js`, etc.) represents different views of the application, handling user interactions and displaying data.
   - **Navigation**: Likely implemented using React Navigation or a similar library to manage routing and screen navigation.
  
2. **Backend (Node.js with Express)**
   - **index.js**: Main entry point for the backend API (`api/index.js`). Sets up Express server, middleware (like bodyParser and cors), connects to MongoDB using Mongoose, and defines routes.
   - **Routes**: Defined routes (`/addEmployee`, `/employees`, `/attendance`, `/attendance-report-all-employees`) handle HTTP requests, interact with MongoDB using Mongoose models (`Employee`, `Attendance`), and return JSON responses.
   - **Models**: Mongoose models (`employee.js`, `attendance.js`) define schemas for Employee and Attendance collections in MongoDB. These models enforce data structure and validations.
   - **Controller Logic**: Controller functions inside route handlers manage business logic, such as adding employees, fetching employee data, marking attendance, and generating attendance reports.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - **Collections**: MongoDB collections (`employees`, `attendances`) store data defined by Mongoose models.
   - **Schema Enforcement**: Mongoose schemas (`employeeSchema`, `attendanceSchema`) enforce structure and rules on data stored in MongoDB.
   - **Queries**: MongoDB queries aggregate data (`aggregate` in `/attendance-report-all-employees`) and retrieve records based on specified criteria (`date` in `/attendance`).

### Flow of Operations

- **Frontend Interaction**: Users interact with the React Native frontend, navigating through screens (`home`, `markattendance`, `summary`, etc.) to perform tasks like viewing employees, marking attendance, and viewing summaries.
- **API Interaction**: Frontend communicates with the backend API (`/addEmployee`, `/employees`, `/attendance`, `/attendance-report-all-employees`) via HTTP requests.
- **Backend Processing**: Express routes handle incoming requests, invoking controller logic to interact with MongoDB via Mongoose models.
- **Database Operations**: MongoDB stores and retrieves data (`Employee`, `Attendance` collections) based on CRUD operations defined by Mongoose models.
- **Response Handling**: Backend sends JSON responses to the frontend, providing requested data or confirmation of operations.
- **Data Presentation**: React Native components render retrieved data (`employee` details, `attendance` records) for users to view and interact with.

### Conclusion

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns between frontend (React Native), backend (Node.js with Express), and database (MongoDB). Each part of the application performs its specific role: frontend handles user interface and interactions, backend manages business logic and data processing, and MongoDB stores and retrieves structured data. This structure enhances scalability, maintainability, and performance of the application. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and future enhancements.
